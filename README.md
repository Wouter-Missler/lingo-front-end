This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Description

This project is a simple front-end application that lets you interact with the back-end of my CISQ1 project. It allows you to create new games, and play them.
It's built using Next.js, a React framework that allows for server-side rendering and static site generation, besides Next I've used Tailwind CSS / Shadcnui for styling and Axios for making HTTP requests to the back-end.

## Usage

To use the front end you will have to have the back-end running on your local machine, hosted on localhost:8080.

You can find the live version of this code hosted [here](https://lingo-cisq-wm.vercel.app/)
